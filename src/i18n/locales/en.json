      },
      {
        "question": "What is Quick3 for WooCommerce?",
        "answer": "Quick3 for WooCommerce is a WordPress plugin that automatically synchronizes products, prices, inventory, orders, and customers between Quick3 ERP and your WooCommerce store. Everything runs in the background, keeping your online store updated with the Quick3 system without manual intervention."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the system requirements?",
        "answer": "The plugin requires: WordPress 6.0 or newer, WooCommerce 7.0 or newer, PHP 8.1 or newer, WP-CLI installed on the server, and a valid Quick3 API token. We strongly recommend a VPS with multiple CPU cores rather than standard web hosting, as synchronization requires processing power for data transformation and product matching."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get a Quick3 API token?",
        "answer": "You can get the API token from your Quick3 account. Once you have it, add it to your WordPress configuration by defining QUICK3_TOKEN in your wp-config.php file: define('QUICK3_TOKEN', 'your-api-token-here'); Read the \"Get Started\" guide for more information about this process. The plugin displays configuration status on the Quick3 Settings page."
      },
      {
        "question": "How often is data synchronized between Quick3 and WooCommerce?",
        "answer": "Synchronization frequency depends on your subscription: Free (manual synchronization only), Business (every 30 minutes), Enterprise (every 15 minutes). You can configure this under WP Admin > Quick3 Settings > Synchronization Settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "What data is synchronized?",
        "answer": "The plugin synchronizes: products and product variants, product names, descriptions and attributes, regular prices and sale prices (including time-based campaigns), stock levels and stock status, product images, orders (from WooCommerce to Quick3), and customer information."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the product limits for each plan?",
        "answer": "Free: Up to 50 products, Business: Up to 10,000 products, Enterprise: Unlimited products. The plugin displays your current usage and limits on the Quick3 Settings page with a visual progress bar."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does the plugin work with Quick3's API limitations?",
        "answer": "Yes, the plugin is designed to work within Quick3's strict API limitations. Instead of making separate API calls for each inventory update, the plugin fetches all products periodically (based on your subscription). This stays well within API limits while keeping your inventory synchronized."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens to my existing WooCommerce products?",
        "answer": "The plugin does not delete existing WooCommerce products. It creates a link between Quick3 products and WooCommerce products using SKU and metadata. If a product exists, it is updated. If no match is found, a new product is created. Existing products not from Quick3 remain untouched."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I troubleshoot if products are not synchronizing?",
        "answer": "Check these common issues first: Verify that the Quick3 API token is correctly configured in Quick3 Settings, check that WordPress cron is working properly, view job status under WP Admin > Jobs to check if any jobs failed, check job logs for specific error messages, and ensure you haven't reached the product limit for your subscription."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I trigger a synchronization manually instead of waiting for automatic sync?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can trigger a product synchronization manually at any time from WP Admin > Quick3 for WooCommerce > Jobs. Click \"New job\" and select the job you want to run. This is useful for testing the connection or immediately updating after changes in Quick3. Quick3's API limitations still apply, but the plugin has built-in protection that prevents you from exceeding these limits."
